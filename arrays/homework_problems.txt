1) Reverse an array.

Implement a function that takes an array and returns an array containing all the elements reversed.

Example:
  reverse([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]


2) Combine two arrays (this is called concatenation).

Implement a function that takes two arrays and makes a new array containing elements from both arrays in order.

Example:
  concatenate([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]


3) Print a tic-tac-toe board

Create a program that can print a two dimensional array as a tic-tac-toe board. The array can be hard-coded in the program.

Example:
  char[][] b = {{ 'x', 'o', 'x'}, { 'o', 'o', 'x' }, { 'o', '', 'x' }};

  Would print:

    x | o | x 
   --- --- ---
    o | o | x
   --- --- ---
    o |   | x 


4) Extend the tic-tac-toe program above to also tell the user which letter won ('x' or 'o').

  The example above would print the board and additionally say "X wins!"


5) Now using the code from #3 and #4, implement a working tic-tac-toe game. The prompts will alternate between X and O and the user will
   input a space number to place their letter.

   Space numbers are:

    0 | 1 | 2 
   --- --- ---
    3 | 4 | 5
   --- --- ---
    6 | 7 | 8 

   The prompts will behave like so:

   > X's turn. Enter the square to place your X: 

   Then the user would enter a number between 0 and 8. If the square is already taken, then have them enter it again. Otherwise, update the board appropriately.
